# Executive Summary

This study seeks to understand how Facebook’s ad delivery algorithms affected the pricing and distribution of political advertisements during the 2024 European Parliament elections. By collaborating with political parties across the EU, we placed neutral “get-out-the-vote” ads using identical targeting criteria with the same budgets, that ran simultaneously across 8 European countries for seven days. The only factors that differed between the ads were the country, the language of the advertisement, and the advertising party and for this reason differences observed between countries and parties may suggest a bias in Facebook's ad delivery algorithm. Our findings highlight significant variations in both ad costs and reach, across parties, target audiences, and political parties, which could suggest bias in how Facebook delivers political ads across different contexts.

### Country Differences



The price of reaching voters through Facebook ads varies dramatically across countries, with a striking 321% difference between the highest and lowest average prices. This means that *a campaign that reaches 100000 voters in one country might only reach 25000 in another*.

Within the same country, political parties face an average price variation of `r perc_avg_lab` for identical ads placed at the same time with the same budget, and for some parties this goes up to `r perc_max_lab`. This creates an uneven playing field in national political landscapes, where some parties can reach significantly more voters than others with the same budget. 

<!-- For example, assuming budgets scale linearly, with a modest budget of €1000 for an ad, ALDE, the most favorably priced party in Flanders, could reach an additional `r scales::number(ceiling(scale_reach_difference(initial_budget, initial_reach_diff, new_budget)))` voters compared to Vooruit, the least favorably priced party in Flanders, for the same budget. -->

### Factors Affecting Ad Costs

**Account-Level Factors:** Political parties with more Facebook page likes paid higher prices for ads, though the correlation between page likes and ad pricing was weak (R = 0.084) and not statistically significant. 

*Political parties that historically spent more on ads in the past had to pay higher costs per thousand users compared to parties that spend less.* Correlations between ad spending and lower prices was moderately high (R values of 0.25 to 0.32). For every 1% increase in a party's historic ad spend (in thousands), the cost to reach 1000 new people increases by about 0.01 Euro (1 cent). This effect is small for individual campaigns but can accumulate for parties with large advertising budgets over time. However, it should be noted that this price difference is mainly driven by European political parties (which tend to spend less on average compared to national parties).


```{r}
# Data for Historic Ad Spend (Key Stats)
historic_spend_data <- data.frame(
  Percentage = c("€0.01"),
  Title = c("Spend more, get charged more"),
  Subtitle = c("For every 1% increase in a party's historic ad spend, the cost to reach users increases by €0.01 for 1000 users in future campaigns. This cumulative effect means larger advertisers may face progressively higher costs over time."),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Display Historic Ad Spend Percentage Section
shiny::HTML(percentage_section(historic_spend_data))
```


**Party-Level Factors - Voter Support:** There was a slight tendency for parties with greater electoral success to pay slightly lower ad prices, but this correlation (R = -0.14) was not statistically significant.

**Advertising Demand and Pricing:** Countries with higher total political ad spending tended to have lower ad prices overall (R = -0.34), however the relationship was not statistically significant. This means that greater competition for ad space did not necessarily lead to higher costs in all cases.

Countries with larger active Facebook user bases tended to see lower ad prices. The size of a country's audience correlated strongly with the price of ads (R = -0.63), indicating that in larger digital markets, political ads could be run at a lower cost.

**Age-Based Differences:** Targeting younger voters (ages 18-24) generally led to higher ad costs in some countries. In several instances, ads targeting younger demographics were more expensive than those targeting older groups, reflecting how ad algorithms value different segments of the electorate.


**Gender-Based Differences:** Ads targeting male audiences were often cheaper in several countries, including Belgium and Germany, while in other countries, the reverse was true. This suggests that the algorithms priced gender targeting differently depending on local market conditions.

```{r, eval = F}

Our findings suggest that Facebook's ad delivery algorithms play a crucial role in shaping the digital political advertising landscape. These algorithms, while designed to optimize ad delivery, may inadvertently be influencing the democratic process in ways we're only beginning to understand.



# Conclusions

Our study reveals significant disparities in the pricing of political advertisements on Facebook across different countries and parties during the 2024 European Parliament elections. These disparities have implications for democratic processes, as they may influence the reach and effectiveness of political campaigns.

Key findings include:

+ Significant price differences exist across countries, with up to a 321% price increase between the highest and lowest average prices.

+ Within countries, parties experience price variations that can impact their potential voter reach significantly. 

+ Factors such as the historical ad spending show some correlation with ad pricing but are not solely determinative.

+ Facebook's ad delivery algorithms, while optimized for efficiency, may inadvertently create inequalities in the political advertising landscape.


# Recommendations

- **Transparency**: Social media platforms should provide greater transparency regarding their ad pricing algorithms to ensure a fair playing field for all political parties.

- **Regulation**: Policymakers may consider regulations that address algorithmic biases in political advertising to protect democratic processes.

- **Further Research**: Additional studies should be conducted to explore the impact of factors such as ad content and user engagement metrics on ad pricing.

- **Need for Testing**: Political campaigns can use the template of this experiment to test their own messages and target audiences.

- **Need for Preparations**: The target group has large effects on the price of an ad. Figuring out the characteristics of the target audience and their algorithmic performance is key to receiving better pricing.

- **Ad Delivery Monitoring**: Political parties should consistently monitor ad delivery data and outcomes to understand the patterns in pricing fluctuations and optimize their ad spending.

- **Focus on New Entrants**: Political campaigns, particularly for newer or smaller parties, should be cautious of the "spending tax" effect. Exploring strategies to maximize their limited budgets early on can help mitigate rising costs as their ad spending increases.

- **Engage with Platforms**: Political parties and regulatory bodies should engage with social media platforms to advocate for fairer ad pricing structures, particularly in sensitive political contexts where a level playing field is crucial.

# Introduction

Political advertising on social media platforms like Facebook has become a crucial tool for political parties to reach voters during election campaigns. Political parties and other advertisers may assume that the price of ads is relatively consistent across countries, audiences, and accounts, [but in reality, that is not the case](https://books.ipskampprinting.nl/thesis/635091-Votta/88/). Facebook uses an [auction-based system](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/430291176997542?id=561906377587030) where advertisers bid for the attention of users, and these bids are influenced by many factors, including local market conditions, user demand, and competition, but also many unknown and potential factors that we explore here. In this study, we aim to uncover why political parties across different countries are charged different prices for the same ads and what factors play a role in these pricing decisions.

By partnering with political parties throughout Europe, we have a unique opportunity to examine how algorithms tangibly affected the 2024 European elections. Our goal is to shed light on the variations in ad pricing and provide insights into Facebook's advertising cost structure. We investigate how different elements - including a party's past advertising expenditure, level of political backing, and even the gender of the reached audience - might influence ad prices. Our findings suggest an intriguing pattern: parties that have historically spent more on advertising may encounter rising costs over time. This could create what we might call a 'spending tax,' potentially putting political groups that invest heavily in certain markets at a disadvantage. Alternatively, we also observe that parties entering the market might face lower initial costs, possibly designed to encourage new advertisers—akin to a 'first months free' model often seen in subscription services. However, further investigation would be needed to confirm these trends.

We also explore how these pricing dynamics vary not just between countries but within them, comparing costs for different political parties and demographic groups. This analysis reveals significant disparities that could have far-reaching implications for political discourse and campaign strategies across Europe. By understanding these pricing mechanisms, we can gain valuable insights into the evolving landscape of digital political advertising and its potential impact on democratic processes in the age of social media.

Are you curious about how your party's ad pricing compares to others? We've created an [interactive dashboard](https://euroalgos.shinyapps.io/explore/) to help you explore these differences. 


## Research Questions and Hypotheses

Our research is guided by two main questions:

- **RQ1**: Do prices for political advertisements differ across countries and parties?

> For instance, if two parties from different countries run the same ad, will they be charged the same amount? And if two parties from the same country but with different levels of support run ads, will they face different costs?

- **RQ2**: What factors influence the price of political advertisements?

> Several factors could play a role in determining how much a party pays for ads. These factors include the number of followers the party has on Facebook, how much they have spent on ads in the past, and the overall demand for ad space during the election period. Below, we explore these factors in detail to understand their impact on ad pricing.


### Specific Research Questions

Several factors can influence the cost of political advertisements on Facebook. These include:

Account-Level Factors: This refers to characteristics of the Facebook account placing the ad. For example, parties with more followers or a higher history of ad spending tend to pay lower prices for their ads. This is because Facebook can more easily match these accounts with relevant audiences, reducing the cost of reaching each voter.

For instance, a party with 100,000 followers might pay less than a smaller party with only 5,000 followers because Facebook’s algorithm has more data to work with, making it easier to show the ad to the right people at a lower cost.

- **RQ2a**: Do account-level factors influence the price for political advertisements?

Party-Level Factors: The characteristics of a political party, such as its level of political support, can also impact ad prices. Parties with broad, mainstream support may pay less for their ads because their messages resonate with a larger audience, making it easier for Facebook to deliver the ad efficiently.

On the other hand, parties with niche or smaller voter bases may face higher prices because their target audience is more difficult to reach. For example, a party focused on environmental issues might have a harder time finding the right audience compared to a larger, more generalist party, leading to higher ad costs.

- **RQ2b**: Do party-level factors influence the price for political advertisements?

Market Context Factors: The overall advertising environment also plays a role. In countries where there is less competition for ad space, political advertisers may benefit from lower prices. Conversely, in countries with more competition, prices can rise sharply during election seasons, especially when many parties are vying for the same audience.

- **RQ2c**: Do market context factors influence the price for political advertisements?

## (Short) Methodology

We conducted an **algorithm audit study** with political parties across Europe, running identical, non-partisan ads on Facebook to encourage voting. Our sample included national parties in parliamentary seats, parties in the European Parliament, and European political groups, securing participation from `r length(unique(overview$party))` parties in `r length(unique(overview$cntry))` countries/regions. Each party ran the same ad text, images, and budgets to isolate the effects of factors like country and audience targeting on pricing. Ads were tested using three target audiences:

1. **Interest in Politics**
2. **Below-University Education**
3. **No Targeting**

We measured cost for thousand users to analyze price variations.

- **Daily Budget**: €1 per ad
- **Campaign Duration**: 7 days
- **Number of Ads**: 5 ad copies per target audience, across 3 audiences
- **Total Investment**: €105 per national actor, 5x for European actors

For a more detailed methodology, please see the final section at the end of this report.

# Results

In this section, we present a comprehensive analysis of our findings regarding ad pricing and reach across European countries during the 2024 European Parliament elections. Our analysis is structured to address our main research questions, followed by exploratory analyses to uncover potential drivers of price differences. 

## Descriptives

We begin by examining descriptive statistics that relate to our primary research question (RQ1): *Do prices for political advertisements differ across countries and parties?* These statistics provide an initial insight into the existence and magnitude of price differences by country and political party.




### Country Differences

In this section we explore differences in prices between countries and audiences. Using data obtained by the political parties, we can show that political parties in different countries running ads at the same time have considerably different costs for reaching the same amount of people.  Figure 2 illustrates the variation in the cost of reaching 1000 users with political ads on Facebook across different European countries during the 2024 European Parliament elections.


```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, fig.cap="The graph illustrates the variation in the cost of reaching 1000 users with political ads on Facebook across different European countries during the 2024 European Parliament elections. The mean and standard deviation for each country are indicated above the respective points. Denmark exhibits the highest average price per 1000 users (1.53 EUR), while Hungary has the lowest average price (0.36 EUR) -  an increase of 321.08%. On average, prices differ by 0.43 EUR or 76% between countries."}

<!-- In Figure 9, to ensure that our comparison is accurate, we exclude parties that used significantly different advertising settings, such as launching their campaigns later (e.g. LINKE, CDU), or spending substantially less in total (Lés Engagés). We have flagged these parties with grey triangles for transparency, but they do not influence the country-level average presented in the graph. -->


<!-- On average, the price disparity between parties *within* countries amounts to 3.47%, which corresponds to an average price difference of 0.04 EUR per 1k reached users. Given the prices we have set, this price difference results in reaching approximately 381 people on average. The maximum observed price disparity between parties is 26.98%, occurring in Flanders, where the highest prices (paid by Vooruit) and lowest ad prices (ALDE) differ substantially by 0.19 EUR per 1k reached users. Given the prices we have set, this difference allows ALDE to reach on average 2,096 more people compared to Vooruit. -->


## Exploratory analysis

Next, we explore account-level, party-level, and market-level factors.


### Account-Level Factors (RQ2a)

#### Number of Page Likes

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300,  fig.cap="This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the number of Facebook page likes and the standardized ad prices for various political parties across European countries during the 2024 European Parliament elections. The x-axis (logarithmic scale) represents the number of page likes, while the y-axis shows the standardized price of ads relative to each country's mean. Each point represents a political party, labeled with its name and country. The blue line indicates the linear regression trend. There is a weak positive correlation (R = 0.084, p = 0.6) between page likes and standardized ad prices, suggesting that parties with more followers tend to pay slightly higher prices relative to their country's average, though this relationship is not statistically significant."}

#### Historic Ad Spend


```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=9, dpi=300,  fig.cap="This figure presents four scatter plots comparing political ad spending and standardized ad prices across various time frames for European political parties. Each plot shows ad spend (log scale) on the x-axis and standardized ad price (deviations from country mean) on the y-axis. A positive trend is observed in all four time periods, with R values ranging from 0.25 to 0.32, though the only statistically significant relationships are for the last 7 days (p = 0.043) and last 90 days (p = 0.038) of spending.

# Methodology


We conducted an **algorithm audit study** where we asked political parties across multiple European countries to run identical political ads on Facebook. These ads were designed to be non-partisan and simply encouraged people to vote. 


Our approach to selecting participants was designed to capture a broad, representative picture of the European political landscape. We cast a wide net, inviting national parties represented in their country's parliament, parties with seats in the European Parliament, and European parties (e.g. European Greens). We also sought to include parties across the political spectrum. From established mainstream parties to newer, emerging political movements, we wanted our sample to reflect the full range of political voices competing for attention in the European political arena. In the end, we secured participation from `r length(unique(overview$party))` political parties across `r length(unique(overview$cntry))` countries/regions.

By using the same ad text, images, and budgets for each party, we aimed to ensure that the only differences in pricing would be due to the factors we were studying—such as the country, the party's characteristics, or the audience being targeted.

The ads were placed in three different conditions:

1. **Interest in Politics**: Ads targeted at people who had expressed interest in politics.
2. **Below-University Education**: Ads targeted at people with below university-levels of education.
3. **No Targeting**: Ads were shown to a general audience (18+, entire country) without any specific targeting.

We collected data on how much each party paid to reach 1,000 users and analyzed how these prices varied across the three conditions.


- **Daily Budget**: €1 per ad
- **Campaign Duration**: 7 days
- **Number of Ads**: 5 ad copies per target audience, across 3 audiences
- **Total Investment**: €105 per national actor, 5x for European actors

Each political party runs one ad campaign with several ad sets, each containing a single ad. This setup ensures that individual ads from the same party and targeting the same audience do not compete against each other. All ads are placed simultaneously, with the same budget, targeting the same audiences to control for temporal heterogeneity.


# Researchers

The research team for this study includes scholars from a range of academic institutions across Europe and North America. Their combined expertise spans algorihtmic governance, political communication, and electoral behavior. They made this comprehensive analysis of ad delivery algorithms in the 2024 European Parliament elections possible.

<!-- ## Sample Reduction -->

<!-- In the following we will only continue to work with parties that meet the following conditions. -->

<!-- 1. ads must have started at the same time (starting April 29th) -->
<!-- 2. ads must have run for 7 days -->
<!-- 3. total spent must have been within same range (i.e. +- 5 Euro) -->


<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # overview %>%  -->
<!-- #  filter(starts == as.Date("2024-04-29"))  %>%  -->
<!-- #  filter(party == "Les Engagés") -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- This leaves us with **`r length(unique(ov$party))` parties** from **`r length(unique(overview$cntry))` regions/countries**. -->



<!-- ## Hypotheses -->

<!-- We are exploring two main hypotheses related to the pricing of political advertisements on Facebook across different countries and political parties. These hypotheses test whether political parties experience different costs when running ads, even when targeting the same audiences with the same advertisements. -->

<!-- The first hypothesis focuses on *whether political ad pricing varies depen on the country* where the ads are being placed.  -->

<!-- 1. **H1**: The price for political advertisements differs across countries. -->


<!-- We expect to observe significant price disparities between countries, with some paying much more for the same audience reach than others. This could be due to a combination of factors such as the number of advertisers, the overall demand for Facebook ads, and the size of the potential audience in each country. -->





<!-- The second hypothesis examines *whether different political parties are charged different prices* for running the same ad, even within the same country. -->

<!-- 2. **H2**: Political parties are charged different prices for running the same political advertisements. -->


<!-- One possible reason for this is Facebook’s ad delivery algorithm, which takes into account not only the content of the ad but also the advertiser’s account characteristics. Parties with more followers or those who have spent more money on ads in the past may be seen as more valuable customers, and thus Facebook may offer them lower prices as a way to encourage more spending. On the other hand, smaller parties or those with less digital presence might be charged more because Facebook has less data about them, making it harder to target their ads efficiently. -->



<!-- In the following sections, we will formally test our hypotheses regarding these observed differences and explore potential factors driving these variations in ad pricing and reach across European countries. -->

<!-- ## Hypothesis Testing -->

<!-- Our approach to analyzing all this data combined rigorous statistical testing with exploratory data analysis. Next, we test our two main hypotheses: -->

<!-- To see if ad prices really do vary across countries (H1), we use a so-called a likelihood ratio test. We compare two statistical models: one that didn't take country into account at all, and one that did. If the model that included country as a factor fit our data significantly better, that would tell us that country really does matter when it comes to ad pricing. -->

<!-- We use the same approach to test whether prices vary between parties (H2). We compared a model that only looked at countries to one that also included individual parties. Again, if including parties in the model made it fit our data better, that would suggest that different parties really do pay different prices for the same ads. -->

<!-- We used multilevel modeling for these tests. This is a statistical technique that's well-suited for data like ours, where we have ads nested within parties, which are in turn nested within countries. -->

<!-- Beyond just testing whether these differences exist, we also wanted to know how big they are. So we estimated the size of the effects that countries and parties have on ad pricing. This helps us understand not just whether these factors matter, but how much they matter. -->

<!-- ### Price Variance Across Countries (H1) -->

<!-- ```{r,eval = F} -->
<!-- ov %>%  -->
<!--   group_by(cntry) %>%  -->
<!--   summarize(price = mean(price)) %>%  -->
<!--   mutate(sddd = sd(price)) -->

<!-- ov %>% summarize(price = mean(price)) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r,eval = F} -->
<!-- 0.9712084 / 0.3574499 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r,eval = F} -->
<!-- # Calculate Coefficient of Variation for all ads -->
<!-- cv_all_ads <- sd(ov$price) / mean(ov$price) * 100 -->

<!-- # Print result -->
<!-- cat("Coefficient of Variation across all ads:", round(cv_all_ads, 2), "%\n") -->

<!-- # You could also calculate it by country -->
<!-- cv_by_country <- ov %>% -->
<!--   group_by(cntry, audience) %>% -->
<!--   summarize(cv = sd(price) / mean(price) * 100) %>%  -->
<!--   group_by(cntry) %>%  -->
<!--   summarize(cv = mean(cv)) -->

<!-- print(cv_by_country) -->

<!-- mean(cv_by_country$cv) -->
<!-- ``` -->



<!-- We used a likelihood ratio test to compare a base model (without country variable) against a model with a random intercept for each country. The test determines whether including countries significantly increases the model's likelihood given the data. -->

<!-- The ANOVA results comparing the two models show a significant improvement when including the country variable (p < 0.001), indicating that ad prices differ by country. The random intercept for country has a standard deviation of 0.357. -->

<!-- This suggests that the country a political ad is placed in can substantially influence the cost, with prices varying by up to 36 Euro cents/1k users around the overall mean. -->

<!-- Our statistical model suggests that country-level differences explain about 91.8% of the variance in ad prices. This is a huge effect, indicating that the country where an ad is placed is the single most important factor in determining its price. -->


<!-- ### Price Variance Across Parties  (H2) -->

<!-- We added a random intercept for parties and conducted an LR-Test to check if including party accounts significantly increases the model's likelihood given the data. -->

<!-- Including party as a nested random effect within country significantly improves the model fit (p < 0.001). The random intercept for party nested within country has a standard deviation of 0.043, indicating some variability in ad pricing between parties within the same country. -->

<!-- The random intercept for party nested within country shows a standard deviation of 4.3 cents for reaching 1k users. Smaller than the country-level variability, this still indicates meaningful differences in ad pricing for different political parties within the same country. It is however also smaller what was found before in the Netherlands (6.5 cents). -->
